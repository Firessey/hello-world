# hello-world
Just another repository
Um, hello. This is a thing I'm doing out of free will. DEFINITELY not because I'm an inexperienced piece of feces. Haha... ha...

But enough about that, here's some facts.
1) Name: ??? (lololololol pranked bro)
2) I am obsessed with way too many things. It's like trying to keep your full closet from opening during your mom's room inspection. 
Mom: Are you hiding anything here?
Me: PFFTT. WHAT? OF COURSE NOT!
*Mom leaves room*
Me: *stares at closet full of a bunch of fandom bullcrap* Man, I oughta clean that soon...
PFFT NAH
3) As that last 'skit thing' might have revealed, I dream of being a comedian. Woop-dee-doo, another child who's got their head stuck in the clouds. Also, I play piano, draw, sing, make stories, and one day want to animate. I also like science. Send help I don't know what to do with my adult life.
4) I am a female. Not really much there, but I get confused for a male online pretty often. Just a tidbit of info.
5) HOI I'M TEM
6) GIANT ROBOT
7) GREEN IS NOT A CREATIVE COLOR.
8) ...well fu-

Anywho, that's just an overview of me embarassing myself on Gi- I MEAN INTRODUCING WHO I AM. YUP.















I need help.
